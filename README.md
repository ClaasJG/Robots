## Programming Robots

This site is dedicated to robot programming.  There are many great resources that show you how to build physical robots and wire up the electronics.  They will often include some basic programming to get the robot moving.  These are fantastic resources for the robot enthusiast but sometimes you may want to do a little more than just get the robot to move.  This site attempts to do just that, we want to get our robots to do really cool things like autonomous navigation, object manipulation, and gesture recognition. Weâ€™ll create a number of projects each of which will have its own robot control challenge to solve.  Each project will come with a series of articles explaining the robot programming challenge is overcome.
